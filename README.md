### LOOKTAB Mobile DApp

- On the user interface level, we created a mobile DApp using Android that enables users to manage their Near Wallet and NFT Reward.
- Users can get NFT Rewards from Airdrop and redeem them in offline stores. Store owners can check their ownership of reward from their wallet id.
- Users can get additional incentives when they contribute to LOOKTAP ecosystem by reviewing some stores and adding useful information.
